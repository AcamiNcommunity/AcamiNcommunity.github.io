					<h3 class="grid-header">What is this server about?</h3>
					<p>Cube is the host of AcamiN and the creator of the server. He had 2 successful discord servers and was admin to a big one for sometime, nevertheless, all the projects he does are out of entertaiment and fun!</p>

					<h3 class="grid-header">What to expect</h3>
					<p>You may expect a group of people who play games and joke around. <em>Do note that the people in this server do have a sense of humor that may seem a bit offensive to some, so fair warning if you are sensitive.</em> We also do giveaways sometimes, and frequent updates. We also have some fun bots to play around with!</p>
