					<h3 class="grid-header">What is this server about?</h3>
					<p>This server is about gaming and other fun stuff! It was made by Cube and some of his friends. In this server, we play Roblox, Brawl Stars, Geometry Dash, and more! We are also interested in anime, like JJK and others.</p>

					<h3 class="grid-header">What to expect</h3>
					<p>You may expect a group of people who play games and joke around. <em>Do note that the people in this server do have a sense of humor that may seem a bit offensive to some, so fair warning if you are sensitive.</em> We also do giveaways sometimes, and frequent updates. We also have some fun bots to play around with!</p>

					<h3 class="grid-header">Who's Cube?</h3>
					<p>Cube is the creator of the server (duh). He originally created this server for his friends but then made it public! He is also a content creator on YouTube. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0ckryUFCGTHa7D2A9Zxztw">You can view his channel here.</a></p>
