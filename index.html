					<h3 class="grid-header">What to expect</h3>
					<p>Expect the unexpected, there's too much fun to be had here, many channels with people to talk to, many people to talk and make jokes, (do note some people have a more dark style of humour.) many bots to play around with, interactive mods, admins and people running AcamiN and the server, frequent server updates, events and special events that include people in videos!</p>
				</div>
				<div class="grid-item">
					<h3 class="grid-header">Who's the host?</h3>
					<p>Cube is the host of AcamiN and the creator of the server. He had 2 successful discord servers and was admin to a big one for sometime, nevertheless, all the projects he does are out of entertaiment and fun!</a></p>

					<h3 class="grid-header">Is this server silly?</h3>
					<p>Yes, very.</p>
